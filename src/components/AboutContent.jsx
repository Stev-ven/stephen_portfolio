                Hello! I'm Stephen, a recent graduate in Electrical and
                Electronics Engineering from Kwame Nkrumah University 
                of Science and Technology with a strong passion for web 
                development. As a creative and detail-oriented Full-stack 
                Developer, I specialize in building user-friendly, visually
                appealing websites and efficient server-side services. I
                have experience in both frontend and backend development
                using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, PHP, Laravel, and MySQL. 
                Skilled in responsive design, database management,
                version control, and API integration, Iâ€™m dedicated to 
                staying current with new technologies and delivering high-quality
                projects on time. Excited to bring my expertise to a dynamic 
                and collaborative development team!
